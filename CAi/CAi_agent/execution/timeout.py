"""
run_with_timeout — run a callable with a deadline.

The implementation uses concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor + Future.cancel,
which is safer than the old ctypes-based thread-kill trick. The underlying
callable still can't be forcibly terminated mid-blocking-call (a Python
thread limitation), but:
  - we return promptly once the deadline elapses
  - we drop our reference to the runaway thread (it's a daemon)
  - we never cause reentrancy on builtins or the interpreter's internals

For truly non-cooperative work (stuck subprocess, blocking I/O), callers
should prefer subprocess-based execution (see bash.py).
