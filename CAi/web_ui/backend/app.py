"""
FastAPI application factory for FullCopilot Web UI.

This module is intentionally thin — it only creates the FastAPI instance,
registers routers, and re-exports set_agent() so launch.py keeps its
existing import path.

Concurrency model:
    The agent is a stateless execution engine. Conversation history lives in
    ConversationStore. Each /api/chat request loads history → runs agent →
    appends results. A global lock serialises chat requests because code
    execution uses a shared REPL kernel (see deps._chat_lock).

Streaming model:
    The agent's run_with_history_streaming() yields token-level events from
    the LLM plus observation events after each code execution.  We forward
    each event as an SSE message so the browser can render incrementally.
